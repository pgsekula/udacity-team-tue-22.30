# Udacity Team / Front End Nanodegree / Sun 21.00 UTC / Resource Log
This repository keep records of useful resources from the team's weekly meetings.

## Week 02 (24 Oct 2015)
This week students and guide will together create *responsive grid layout* using different CSS techniques.
**In conclusion**, *flexbox* is the most semantic, powererful, easy-to-understand way to layout a web page.
(Other css layout techniques either need some sort of tweak / hack or using properties that doesn't
seem to relate.)
